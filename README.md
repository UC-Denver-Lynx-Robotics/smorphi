## Overview

This project is focused on building a **Smorphi** robot. The robot is designed to perform the following tasks:

### Currently there are 2 bots of this type.  Bot 2 is loaded with app controlled code and bot 1 is working with a preprogrammed sequence.

- Drive around.

### Goals

- ~~**Fix the bots**: Get bot #2 working - currently it is broken.~~
- **tbd...**: ...

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-org]/[robot-name].git
```

### Directory Breakdown

#### 1. `software/`:

This folder contains all the code for controlling the robot, sensor integration, and algorithms such as pathfinding and decision-making.

- **Control System**: Contains the core logic to control the robot’s movements.
- **Navigation (if applicable)**: Handles pathfinding and obstacle avoidance algorithms (used in MicroMouse).
- **Sensors**: Code for integrating sensors like ultrasonic, IR, or other proximity sensors.

To contribute to the software, check out the [Software Team README](./software/README.md) for instructions on setting up the development environment, coding standards, and how to submit changes.

#### 2. `hardware/`:

The hardware folder includes all the CAD models, 3D printing files, and assembly instructions for the robot.

- **CAD Models**: Design files for the robot’s mechanical structure.
- **3D Printing**: STL files for any parts that need to be 3D printed.
- **Assembly**: Instructions and diagrams for assembling the robot.

For more details on contributing to the hardware designs, see the [Hardware Team README](./hardware/README.md).

#### 3. `electrical/`:

This folder contains the robot’s circuit diagrams, motor driver setups, and battery management systems.

- **Schematics**: Circuit diagrams for the robot’s power distribution and control systems.
- **Motor Control**: Code and wiring diagrams for the robot’s motors.
- **Battery Management**: Systems for managing power flow to motors and sensors.

Refer to the [Electrical Team README](./electrical/README.md) for further details on contributing to the electrical systems.

## Contributing
