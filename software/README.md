# Software Team - [Robot Name] - [Competition Name]

## Overview

This folder contains the code for controlling [Robot Name] for the [Competition Type]. The software includes control logic, sensor integration, and any pathfinding or decision-making algorithms.

### Key Components

- **Control System**: [Describe how the control system works].
- **Sensors**: [Describe sensor integration, if applicable].
- **Navigation**: [If applicable, describe how the navigation system works].

### Getting Started

#### What You Need:
- **Programming language and version** C++ 14, C
- **Hardware tools**:
     - Arduino IDE
     - Github Desktop

### Working With The Robot
- **How to upload the code to the bot**: (1) Unplug + plug back in and (2) press reboot button at the connecting point of upload in arduino _every time_.
- **How to run uploaded code on the bot**: (1) turn on (if it isn't already) and (2) press the reset button
- **To connect to the board on Arduino**: use ESP32 Dev Module
